Ⅰ. Project Introduction
The Metal-doped Nanozyme Database and Fe(3-x)CoxO4 Nanozyme Dataset project is an open platform dedicated to collecting, organizing and sharing data related to metal-doped nanozymes. Through this project, we hope to provide researchers in the field of nanozymes with convenient tools for querying and analyzing information on metal-doped nanozymes and to promote the development of the field of nanozymes.

Ⅱ. Project Functions
1. data collection: include different types, sources and properties of metal-doped nanozymes data with Fe(3-x)CoxO4 nanozymes data.
2. Calculation of metal-doped nanozymes: Provide calculation schemes and parameters for each performance parameter of metal-doped nanozymes.
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): analyzing the influence of individual nanozymes' characteristic information on the nanozymes' classification situation.
